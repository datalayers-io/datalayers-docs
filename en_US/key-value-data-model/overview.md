# Overview

The Key-Value data model is one of the core capabilities of Datalayers, providing a distributed, transactional, and strongly consistent Key-Value storage system. Datalayers is fully compatible with the Redis protocol and supports commonly used data structures. For more details, refer to the [Redis Compatibility](./redis-compatibility.md).

## Features

* Fully compatible with the Redis protocol, allowing integration with Redis-related clients.
* Supports commonly used Redis data structures, see Redis Compatibility.
* Supports PB-level key-value storage, significantly reducing server resource and operational costs.
* Simple migration, allowing transition from Redis to Datalayers without code modifications.

Future updates will include features that map SQL operations to key-value operations, enabling interoperability between SQL and key-value models, further enhancing the versatility of our platform.
