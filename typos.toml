# Add files to this list if you don't want these files to be checked by the typo checker.
# For e.g., `extend-exclude = [ "foo", "*.bar" ]` states that the file named "foo" and all files ends with ".bar" will be ignored by the typo checker.

# Add word correction as key-value pairs. 
# For e.g., `"abc" = "def"` states that the word `abc` is miss spelled and its correct form is `def`.
